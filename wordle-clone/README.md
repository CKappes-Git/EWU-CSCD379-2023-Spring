# Bad ideas that aren't unique and we should NEVER use:
1. The ability to randomize the colors for correct, misplaced and incorrect.
    This could be a fun challenge mode, but it wouldn't be difficult enough to justify including.  
2. Change the number of guesses you get.
    Might be interesting, but probably not.
3. Warn users when they enter words that are known to be incorrect.
    Entering incorrect words can be a nice way to guess (you know 't' isn't the last letter but a word ending with 't' might reveal other letters).  That said, it is still probably a waste of a guess so maybe we should warn the less observant player.
